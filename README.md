# stub! - a better todo!

[![Build](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev/stub-macro/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DenisGorbachev/stub-macro)
[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/stub-macro/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/stub-macro)

`stub!()` is a better version of `todo!()`

`todo!()` can’t be assigned to a variable. But `stub!()` can be assigned like this: `let username = stub!(String)`, so you can specify the type of the variable, but not its value.

### Examples

```rust
pub fn simple() {
    // you can assign stub!() to a variable
    let username = stub!(String);
    println!("Hello {username}")
}

pub fn stub_in_return_position() -> String {
    // you can use stub!() like todo!() in return position
    stub!()
}

pub fn more_assignment_examples() {
    // you can let the compiler automatically infer the type
    let status = stub!();
    # if status { println!("Success") }
    let status: bool = stub!();
    let status = stub!(bool);
    let status = stub!(bool, "Assigned to: {}", "John");
}

pub fn impl_example() -> impl Iterator<Item=u32> {
    // `impl Trait` must be written as `impl dyn Trait` due to `macro_rules!` limitation
    stub!(impl dyn Iterator<Item=u32>)
}

pub fn explicit_type_with_message_example() -> u32 {
    stub!(u32, "Assigned to: {}", "John")
}

pub fn explicit_type_example() -> u32 {
    stub!(u32)
}

pub fn implicit_type_with_message_example() -> u32 {
    stub!("Assigned to: {}", "John")
}

pub fn implicit_type_example() -> u32 {
    stub!()
}
```

### Behavior

When a stub is invoked, it will panic like a `todo!()` macro.
However, unlike a `todo!()` macro, it will not make the subsequent parts of your code unreachable.

If a custom message is provided, it will be included in the panic message.

### Notes

* The stub! macro is intended for use during development and should be
  replaced with actual implementations before production use.
* When using `impl Trait` in return position, you must use `impl dyn Trait` in the macro invocation due to a limitation in `macro_rules!`
